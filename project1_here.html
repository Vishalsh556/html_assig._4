<h1 id="h1" >About A. P. J. Abdul Kalam</h1>
<h1> A. P. J. Abdul Kalam</h1><hr>
<p  class="class">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (listen); 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5]

Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",[6] he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.

While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.[7] Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.[8]</p>

<h1><u>Early life and education</u></h1><hr>
<p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family 
in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now
 in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a 
 local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.[10][11][12][13] His father owned a ferry
 that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.
 [14][15] Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.[16][17][18] His 
 ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land.
 Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders 
 and local women. The family business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and 
 from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge
 to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income. [19][20][21]</p>
<img src="apj1.jpg" width="200" height="200"><img src="apj2.jpg" width="200" height="200"> 
<p>In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a 
strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics.[21] After completing his education 
at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, 
Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954.[22]
 He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.[13] While Kalam was
 working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke 
 his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline."[23] He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.[24]</p>
<h1 ><u>Career as a scientist</u></h1><hr>
<p >After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development 
Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of 
India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started 
his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.[26] Kalam 
joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[13] He was interviewed and 
recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS).
[27] In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project 
director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in 
near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO 
in 1965.[1] In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.
[25]<br>

In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center 
in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.[11][28] Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort
 to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to 
 be successful.</p>
 <h1><u>Presidency</u></h1><hr>
 <p  class="class">Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential 
 election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted 
 from 25 July 2002, to 25 July 2007.[39]<br>
 Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam, Narayanan chose not to seek a second term in office,
 leaving the field clear.[44] Kalam said of the announcement of his candidature:<br>
 I am really overwhelmed. Everywhere both in Internet and in other media, I have been asked for a message. 
 I was thinking what message I can give to the people of the country at this juncture.[45]<br>
 On 18 June, Kalam filed his nomination papers in the Indian Parliament, accompanied by Vajpayee
 and his senior Cabinet colleagues.[46]</p>
 <h1><u>Post-presidency</u></h1><hr>
 <p  class="class">After leaving office, Kalam became a visiting professor at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, and the Indian Institute of Management Indore; an honorary fellow of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore;[79] chancellor of the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology Thiruvananthapuram; professor of Aerospace Engineering at Anna University; and an adjunct at many other academic and research institutions across India. He taught information technology at the International Institute of Information Technology,
 Hyderabad, and technology at Banaras Hindu University and Anna University.[80]<br>
 In 2011, Kalam was criticised by civil groups over his stand on the Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant; he supported the establishment of the nuclear power plant and was accused of not speaking with the local people.[81] The protesters were hostile to his visit as they saw him as a pro-nuclear scientist and were unimpressed by the assurances he provided regarding the safety features of the plant.
 [82]<br>
 In May 2012, Kalam launched a programme for the youth of India called the What Can I Give Movement, with a central theme of defeating 
 corruption.[83][84]
 </p>
 <h1><u>Death</u></h1><hr>
 <p>On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest.[85] At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed.[86][87] He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life.[86] Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m. IST.[86][88][89] His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: 
 "Funny guy! Are you doing well?"[90]<br>
 Following his death, Kalam's body was airlifted in an Indian Air Force helicopter from Shillong to Guwahati, from where it was flown to New Delhi on the morning of 28 July in an air force C-130J Hercules. The flight landed at Palam Air Base that afternoon and was received by the President, the vice-president, the Prime Minister, Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal, and the three service chiefs of the Indian Armed Forces, who laid wreaths on Kalam's body.[91] His body was then placed on a gun carriage draped with the Indian flag and taken to his Delhi residence at 10 Rajaji Marg; there, the public and numerous dignitaries paid homage, including former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice-president Rahul Gandhi, 
 and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.[92]<br>
 On the morning of 29 July, Kalam's body, wrapped in the Indian flag, was taken to Palam Air Base and flown to Madurai in an air force C-130J aircraft, arriving at Madurai Airport that afternoon. His body was received at the airport by the three service chiefs and national and state dignitaries, including cabinet ministers Manohar Parrikar, Venkaiah Naidu, Pon Radhakrishnan and the governors of Tamil Nadu and Meghalaya, K Rosaiah and V. Shanmuganathan. After a brief ceremony, Kalam's body was flown by air force helicopter to the town of Mandapam, from where it was taken in an army truck to his hometown of Rameswaram. Upon arriving at Rameswaram, his body was displayed in an open area in front of the local bus station to allow the public to pay their final respects until 8 p.m. 
 that evening.[93][94]<br>
 On 30 July 2015, the former president was laid to rest at Rameswaram's Pei Karumbu Ground with full state honours. Over 350,000 people attended the last rites, including the Prime Minister, the governor of Tamil Nadu and the chief ministers of Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.
 [95][96]
 </p>
 <h1><u>Reactions</u></h1><hr>
 <p>India reacted to Kalam's death with an outpouring of grief; numerous tributes were paid to the former president across the nation and on social media.[97] The Government of India declared a seven-day state mourning period as a mark of respect.[98] President Pranab Mukherjee, Vice-president Hamid Ansari, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, and other leaders condoled the former President's demise.[88] Prime Minister Narendra Modi said "Kalam's death is a great loss to the scientific community. He took India to great heights. He showed the way."[99] Former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh, who had served as prime minister under Kalam, said, "our country has lost a great human being who made phenomenal contributions to the promotion of self-reliance in defence technologies. I worked very closely with Dr. Kalam as prime minister and I greatly benefited from his advice as president of our country. His life and work will be remembered for generations to come."[100] ISRO chairman A. S. Kiran Kumar called his former colleague "a great personality and a gentleman", while former chairman G. Madhavan Nair described Kalam as "a global leader" for whom "the downtrodden and poor people were his priority. He always had a passion to convey what is in his mind to the young generation", adding that his death left a 
 vacuum which none could fill.[101][102]</p>

 <h1><u>Memorial</u></h1><hr>
 <p  class="class">The Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam National Memorial[117] was built in memory of Kalam by the DRDO in Pei Karumbu, in the island town of Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. It was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in July 2017.[118][119] On display are the replicas of rockets and missiles which Kalam had worked with. Acrylic paintings about his life are also displayed along with hundreds of portraits depicting the life of the mass leader. There is a statue of Kalam in the entrance showing him playing the Veena. There are two other smaller statues of the leader 
 in sitting and standing posture.[120]</p>
 <h1><u>Personal life</u></h1><hr>
 <p>Kalam was the youngest of five siblings, the eldest of whom was a sister, Asim Zohra (d. 1997), followed by three elder brothers: Mohammed Muthu Meera Lebbai Maraikayar (5 November 1916 – 7 March 2021),[121][122] Mustafa Kalam (d. 1999) and Kasim Mohammed (d. 1995).[123] He was extremely close to his elder siblings and their extended families throughout his life, and would regularly send small sums of money to his older relations, himself remaining a 
 lifelong bachelor.[123][124]<br>
 Kalam was noted for his integrity and his simple lifestyle.[124][125] He never owned a television, and was in the habit of rising at 6:30 or 7 a.m. and sleeping by 2 a.m.[126] His few personal possessions included his books, his veena, some articles of clothing, a CD player and a laptop; at his death, he left no will, and his possessions went to his eldest brother, 
 who survived him.[127][128]
 </p>
 <h1 ><u>Religious and spiritual views</u></h1><hr>
 <p>Religion and spirituality were very important to Kalam throughout his life.[129] He made his own spiritual journey the subject of his final book, Transcendence: My Spiritual Experiences with Pramukh Swamiji.
 [130][131]</p>
 
  <h1><u>Islam</u></h1><hr>
 <p>A proud and practising Muslim, daily namaz and fasting during Ramadan were integral to Kalam's life.[9][132][133] His father, the imam of a mosque in his hometown of Rameswaram, had strictly instilled these Islamic customs in his children.[9] His father had also impressed upon the young Kalam the value of interfaith respect and dialogue. As Kalam recalled: "Every evening, my father A. P. Jainulabdeen, an imam, Pakshi Lakshmana Sastry, the head priest of the Ramanathaswamy Hindu temple, and a church priest used to sit with hot tea and discuss the issues concerning the island."[130][134] Such early exposure convinced Kalam that the answers to India's multitudinous issues lay in "dialogue and cooperation" among the country's religious, social, and political leaders.[132] Moreover, since Kalam believed that "respect for other faiths" was one of the key cornerstones of Islam, he was fond of saying: "For great men, religion is a way of making friends; 
 small people make religion a fighting tool."[135]</p>
  <h1><u>Syncretism</u></h1><hr>
 <p>One component of Kalam's widespread popularity among diverse groups in India, and an enduring aspect of his legacy, is the syncretism he embodied in appreciating various elements of the many spiritual and cultural traditions of India.[132][133][136][137] In addition to his faith in the Quran and Islamic practice, Kalam was well-versed in Hindu traditions; he learnt Sanskrit,[138][139] read the Bhagavad Gita[140][141] and he was a vegetarian.[142] Kalam also enjoyed writing Tamil poetry, playing the veena (an Indian string instrument),[143] and listening to Carnatic devotional music every day.[133] In 2002, in one of his early speeches to Parliament after becoming president, he reiterated his desire for a more united India, stating that "during the last one year I met a number of spiritual leaders of all religions ... and I would like to endeavour to work for bringing about unity of minds among the divergent traditions of our country".[136] Describing Kalam as a unifier of diverse traditions, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor stated, "Kalam was a complete Indian, an embodiment of the eclecticism of India's heritage of diversity".[133] BJP leader L. K. Advani concurred that Kalam was "the best exemplar of the Idea of India, one who embodied the best of all the cultural and spiritual traditions that signify India's unity in immense diversity. This was most strikingly evident in the second-to-last book he published, presciently titled Transcendence:
 My Spiritual Experiences with Pramukh Swami".[137]</p>
 <h1 ><u>Pramukh Swami as Guru</u></h1><hr>
 <p  class="class">Kalam's desire to meet spiritual leaders to help create a more prosperous, spiritual, and unified India was what initially led him to meet Pramukh Swami, the Hindu guru of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sampradaya, who Kalam would come to consider his ultimate spiritual teacher and guru.[130][132] The first of eight meetings between Kalam and Pramukh Swami over a fourteen-year period took place on 30 June 2001, in New Delhi, during which Kalam described being immediately drawn to Pramukh Swami's simplicity and spiritual purity.[144] Kalam stated that he was inspired by Pramukh Swami throughout their numerous interactions. One such incident occurred the day following the terrorist attack on BAPS' Akshardham, Gandhinagar complex in September 2002; Pramukh Swami prayed for, and sprinkled holy water upon, the sites of all of the deceased, including the terrorists, demonstrating the view that all human life is sacred. Kalam recalled being moved by Pramukh Swami's equanimity and compassion, citing this incident as one of his motivations for writing Transcendence: My Spiritual Experiences with Pramukh Swamiji.[145] Summarising the effect that Pramukh Swami had on him, Kalam stated that "[Pramukh Swami] has indeed transformed me. He is the ultimate stage of the spiritual ascent in my life ... Pramukh Swamiji has put me in a God-synchronous orbit. No manoeuvres are required any more, as I am placed in my final position in eternity."[132][146] Following Kalam's death a month after his final book was released, co-author Arun Tiwari pointed to this passage as potentially 
 prophetic and premonitory of Kalam's death.[147]</p>
